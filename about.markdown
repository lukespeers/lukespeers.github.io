After working for 5 years as a software developer in enterprise forecasting in Markham, Canada Luke now works as an IT consultant for the snow tourism industry in Western Canada. Luke spends his free time advancing his FPV drone adventures, writing and performing his own music, and jumping at every cool opportunity that comes up.


I also am currently developing another website side project. The aim is to have an easy way to find local food specials going on in my town. This way creating awareness and promoting local businesses in the process. I am currently building this in C# using Razor Pages, Microsoft SQL Server, and Deploying to Azure.
